        <h1>Network Security</h1>

            üõ°Ô∏è Network Security
At Bright Future Gaming, maintaining a secure and reliable network infrastructure is critical to protecting our systems, players, and intellectual property. Network security ensures our development environments, game servers, and corporate systems remain protected against external and internal threats.

üîê Key Principles
Defense in Depth:
We apply multiple layers of defense ‚Äî firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), endpoint protection, and network segmentation ‚Äî to reduce risk and limit potential attack surfaces.

Least Privilege Access:
Access to network resources is granted strictly on a need-to-know basis. All employee devices are assigned roles with the minimum necessary permissions.

Segmentation of Environments:
Game development, production servers, and internal office networks are isolated from each other using Virtual LANs (VLANs) and firewalls to contain breaches and minimize cross-network threats.

Encryption & Secure Protocols:
All sensitive data transferred over the network must use encryption (e.g., TLS/SSL, SSH). Plaintext protocols (e.g., FTP, Telnet) are strictly prohibited.

Secure Wi-Fi Policy:
Office Wi-Fi is protected with WPA3 encryption and hidden SSIDs. A separate guest network is provided with strict limitations and no access to internal systems.

Firewall Configuration:
Firewalls are regularly updated and configured to whitelist essential services and block unauthorized ports or IP ranges.

üì° Remote Access & VPN
Remote access to internal systems is only allowed through the company-approved Virtual Private Network (VPN). Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all VPN logins. Unsecured remote desktop tools are forbidden.

üõë Intrusion Monitoring
We continuously monitor for suspicious activity through:

Network anomaly detection tools

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)

Automated alerts and regular log analysis

üîÑ Regular Audits & Updates
Monthly vulnerability scans are performed across all network devices.

Patching schedules ensure all firmware, routers, and firewall software stay up to date.

Penetration testing is conducted bi-annually to test our defenses.
